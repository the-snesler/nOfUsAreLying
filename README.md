# $N$ of Us Are Lying
A game of deception and deduction, inspired by Tom Scott's YouTube series ["Two of These People Are Lying"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UAOs9B9UH8&pp=ygUcb25lIG9mIHVzIGlzIGx5aW5nIHRvbSBzY290dA%3D%3D) and Jackbox's Fibbage game. 

## How to play:
1. Each player has a device with internet access (phone, tablet, laptop, etc). There also needs to be a device with a 16:9 screen ratio to act as the "host": it displays the current article, summaries, and voting options for all players to see.
2. You and your friends each read up about 2 random Wikipedia articles apiece, and write a short summary of each.
3. Those articles are presented in a random order, and everyone who _didn't_ write a summary for that article has to make something up that sounds plausible. Sometimes an article comes up that no one has read, and everyone has to make something up for it.
4. Everyone presents on their summaries, expanding the descriptions and answering questions.
5. After all the presentations, everyone votes on which summaries they think are fake. Voting for the true summary earns you points, while voting for a fake summary earns points for the person who wrote it.
6. After several rounds, the player with the most points wins!
